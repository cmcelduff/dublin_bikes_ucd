# Dublin_Bikes

A Flask-based journey planner displays all DublinBikes stations in Dublin with real-time availability. Users can enter a location to find the nearest station with available bikes or stands. Data sourced from JCDecaux: https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/opendata/vls?page=getstarted. Users can also specify a time and date for future travel to see predicted availability at a station, determined using a model trained on bike availability and weather data stored in a database.
